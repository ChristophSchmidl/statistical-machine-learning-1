# Statistical Machine Learning
Repo for the course Statistical Machine Learning NWI-NB054E (2015-2016) at the Radboud University. For this course we had to complete four different assignments:
* Assignment 1: Polynomial curve fitting, gradient descent and probability theory
* Assignment 2: Sequential learning (ML and MAP)
* Assignment 3: Bayesian linear regression and logistic regression (IRLS)
* Assignment 4: Neural networks (incl. regression) and expectation-maximization

All the assignments are implemented in Python (2.7), using SciPy, NumPy and matplotlib.
The reports for each assignment are included and are written in LaTeX.
